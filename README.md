# Text_recognition_tesseract
Text recognition using OpenCV and Tesseract engine 

The purpose of this project is to extract text from images using OpenCV and Tesseract. Optical character recognition is used to make editable or even digitised text from scanned images and photographs. In this project we have tried to implement these techniques on digital images. 

We have also tried to extend these text extraction techniques to languages such as marathi.This made our code more versatile and easy to use for non native speakers of english. Since these text extraction techniques can be extended to scanned documents as well, our project aims to lessen the workload on teachers as well.

Some limitations of Tesseract OCR have also been covered. Necessary improvements required in the input images have also been suggested.

(Use Preprocessing of images as requirements)
